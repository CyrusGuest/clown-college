        <p>
          In the summer of 1989, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, two devoted clowns from
          the local Shrine Clown units, Joey "Jingles" McGee from the Oshkosh
          Shrine's Clown Unit, and Marvin "Merry" Lewis from the Wisconsinite
          Shrine's Clown Unit, came together with a visionary idea. Inspired by
          the successful training programs of other Shrine Clown units, they
          aimed to expand their educational efforts to include a wider array of
          clowns across the Midwest region.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          The inaugural classes of their ambitious project, the Northeast Clown
          Institute, commenced on January 28, 1990, in a vibrant community
          center in Oshkosh. This first class was a resounding success, seeing
          40 enthusiastic clowns graduate. The following year, the curriculum
          was enriched to offer advanced courses for second-year clowns. On
          January 20, 1991, in a larger venue in Oshkosh, 65 clowns proudly
          received their certificates.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Recognizing the need for an even more comprehensive training, a third
          tier of classes was introduced for third-year clowns. The January 19,
          1992 graduation ceremony in Oshkosh was a landmark event, with 102
          clowns completing this advanced level of training.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          As the institute's reputation grew, the January 17, 1993 class in
          Oshkosh was a record-breaker, graduating 138 clowns. The institute
          then introduced specialized Round-Table Seminars for students who had
          completed three or more years of training. This innovation was
          well-received, and on January 23, 1994, in Oshkosh, 170 clowns
          graduated, marking the largest class to date.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a significant move in January 1998, the Northeast Clown Institute
          relocated its base to a scenic spot in Oshkosh, not far from the
          historic Lake Winnebago, a site of great cultural and historical
          significance in Wisconsin.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Opening its doors to the public in 1999, the institute underwent a
          name change from the North East Shrine Clown Institute to the more
          inclusive Northeast Clown Institute. Despite the change, its
          charitable focus remained steadfast, continuing to support the
          International Shrine Clown Association's Sneaker Fund. Over the years,
          the institute has proudly welcomed and graduated more than 850 clowns
          from across the United States and Canada, all trained in the artful
          and heartfelt craft of clowning at the Northeast Clown Institute in
          Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
